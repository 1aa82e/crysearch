	- Changed the 'Go to Address' button in the Disassembly window to go to the lower neighbor in case the address is not exact;
	- Added column in process selection window to display icon associated to main window of a process;
	- Added option in process selection window to hide processes that do not have a main window;
	- Added dragging area in process selection window that allows the user to drag the mouse to the window of the desired process;
	- Added button in module window to dump entire process into folder which includes all modules of the process;

v1.05
	- Fixed major crash when opening processes which executable's IAT is mangled or modified;
